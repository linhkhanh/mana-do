### Set up in localhost
- Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies.
- Run ```npm start:frontend``` 
- Run ```npm run test``` to run all test
- Sign in using username: `firstUser`, password: `example`

## What I have done
- Implement the persistent feature. After refreshing, the data is still there: using localstorage
- Implement the edit functionality: double click a task then a modal will be opened and show a form for editing task
- Separate the code into different components
- Write test for reducer and api-frontend
- Add CSS to update UI
- Fix bug: createTodo function is called twice
    
### Disadvantage
- Still haven't tested for all components
